# bookSearchApolloGraphRefact
  Deployed Site:  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/protected-fjord-18200
  
## Description
  This site was made to allow a user to search googles data base for books that they would like to read and then save them to their profiles.
  Each book provide the link to purchase directly from google. My assignment with this was to replace the existing RestFul API with Apollo Server/Graphql.
